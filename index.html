    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Threads Trends HK ("we", "our", "us") is a trend monitoring tool that analyzes publicly available content on Meta's Threads platform to identify trending topics in Hong Kong. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect data.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We access publicly available Threads posts through the official Threads API. This includes:</p>
    <p>- Post text content, timestamps, and engagement metrics (likes, replies) of public posts<br>
    - Public usernames associated with posts<br>
    - Aggregated keyword and topic data derived from public posts</p>

    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>We use this data solely to identify and display trending topics and keywords on the Threads platform in Hong Kong. We do not sell, share, or distribute any personal data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Aggregated trend data (keywords, post counts, trend scores) is stored in a local database. Individual post content is used for analysis only and is not permanently stored beyond what is needed for trend calculation.</p>

    <h2>User Authentication</h2>
    <p>Our application uses the Threads API OAuth authentication. We only request the minimum permissions necessary for our functionality. Access tokens are stored securely and are never shared.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>If you wish to revoke access, you can do so through your Threads account settings under Website Permissions. Upon revocation, we will delete any stored access tokens associated with your account.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the official Meta Threads API. Your use of Threads is subject to Meta's own privacy policy and terms of service.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
